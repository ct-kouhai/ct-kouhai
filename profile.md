- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ct-kouhai, you call me "ct".
- I play osu!, and do terrible in school because I ruin my sleep schedule with it ðŸ˜œ
- ðŸ‘€ Generally interested in graphic design, but I'm also really interested in programming, not sure what I want to do yet...
- ðŸŒ± Currently in freshman year of highschool, mostly online at WAVA, but also taking Alg 2 and band at an in-person public school.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me @ct-kohai#9516 on discord, no email cause I never look at my emails, I only look at notifications from discord.
